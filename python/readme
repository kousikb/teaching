# Python - A Crash Course by Example
Dr. Victor Pankratius, MIT

This material aims to bring you up to speed with Python. It assumes you already know another programming language. I'm trying to be as concise as possible, I don't want to waste your time.

As a pedagogical approach, I'm choosing situations with things you might want to do. Then I'll show code examples with comments to showcase Python capabilities. You'll learn sytax and semantics as you go. 
Along the way I'll be explaining the underlying programming language concepts and issues you might run into when things don't go well.
You will also gain insight into the historical context of programming languages - some ideas are more gegeral than Python and you will see them in other languages as well.
Not all of my comments are in the notebooks, so you'll have to come to my lectures.

Have fun!

Victor
